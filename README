DualSig Contract Documentation:

There are two Ethereum wallets, each controlled by director A and director B.

Directors A and B both have equal leverage and authority in the dual-sig contract system.

Either directors A or B can invoke a proposed amount of Ether/Tokens to be moved to a proposed address. The initiating person invokes the proposal() function, which causes the proposal variables to become populated.

After one person invokes the proposal() function, there are three potential scenarios which the other person can go through:

1. The other person invokes the accept() function, which causes the proposed transaction to actuate.

2. The other person invokes the reset() function, which causes the proposed transaction to become cleared and hence declined.

3. The other person abstains from invoking any functions. If overrideTime amount of time (seconds( elapses since the initial invocation of proposal() from the original person, then the original person is permitted to invoke the accept() function themselves, which actuates the transaction.

The smart contract is also equipped with functions that allow the public address definitions of the wallets of directors A and B to be transferred.
